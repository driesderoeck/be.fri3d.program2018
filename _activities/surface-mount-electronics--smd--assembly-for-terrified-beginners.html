<p>You will learn to assemble tiny parts on circuit boards. Anyone can do it. Yes, even you who never touched anything electronic before.</p>
<p>We will make two dc-dc converters (step-up and step-down) using tiny SMD parts. They will work. After this, you'll no longer be scared of SMD. Avoid caffeine immediately before, shaky hands are a disadvantage. </p>
