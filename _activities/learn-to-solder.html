<p>Mitch has taught tens of thousands of people of all ages to solder.  It is easy, useful, and fun!  Mitch has plenty of cool kits available, all designed for beginners to complete successfully, but cool enough that anyone may want to make one (or more). Kits include: TV-B-Gone kit (turn off TVs from 50m away!), ArduTouch music synthesizer kit,...</p>
